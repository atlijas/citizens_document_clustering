# Citizens Document Clustering

- Document clustering for Citizens Foundation.
- Built using document embeddings from Gensim by RaRe-Technologies.
- Our Doc2Vec model assumes lemmas, although inflected words work, too.
- Icelandic texts are lemmatized using ice_lemma_extraction.py, which is
built on Reynir by Mideind.
- English texts are lemmatized using en_lemmatizer.py, which is supported
by spaCy.
- This repository is a work in progress.
