# Citizens Document Clustering

This tool uses document embeddings from Gensim by @RaRe-Technologies
to classify and make clusters from documents.

Texts are lemmatized using nouns_lemmas_extractions.py, which was built around
Reynir by @mideind. As of now, lemmatization is only available for Icelandic
but will later on become available for English.
